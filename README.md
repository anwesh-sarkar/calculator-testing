<h2>Testing a Basic Calculator</h2>

This automation framework is based on jest-puppeteer and Cucumber. I chose Jest because the framework is well documented, with a large community. Setting up and running headless is easy. Jest is fast and the integration with Puppeteer is smooth.
Most companies follow a BDD approach and, hence, I decided to use Cucumber as well. Writing out tests in Gherkin make it easy for any user to understand.

The framework has only been setup for basic single operations of Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division. The next step would be set it up to deal with multiple arithmetic operations.
